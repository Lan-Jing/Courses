# [Homework] The GCD and LCM

# Description

Give you two integers, and calculate their GCD\(Greatest Common Divisor\) and LCM\(Least Common Multiple\). If both of them are positive, print the GCD and LCM. If some are invalid\(zero or negative\), print $invalid$.

## input 
First line is the integer $t \in [1, 100]$, which indicates how many tests will be performed. 
Next, in each line of the n lines, there are two intergers a_i in [0, 10000] and b_i in [0, 10000].

## output
If both of them are positive, print the GCD and LCM. If some are invalid\(zero or negative\), print ``invalid``.

## Sample Input
```
2
0 10
2 10
```

## Sample Output
```
invalid
2 10
```

# Hint

You may not learn the algorithms of calculating LCM and GCD in your primary school or middle school. So you can serach about them, or read the instruction in wikipedia about [Least Common Multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) and [Greatest Common Divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor).
